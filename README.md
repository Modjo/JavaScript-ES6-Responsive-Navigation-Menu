# JavaScript ES6 Responsive Navigation Menu

As I was stopping a little bit with my Angular lessons, I just reopened an old project that I made a few years ago. I remember back then bein really proud of my jQuery responsive navigation menu. Time flies !
I decided to took a few minutes this evening to rewrite it in JavaScript and to follow as much as possible the new ES6 syntax.
You'll see, there are still a lot of room for improvements but the nav is perfectly working and it takes only a few octets.

As improvements we could:

- Put the classList.toggle() and classList.remove() functions in respective function and call them.
- Not using a for loop
- Minify the code so it loses even more weight

You can definitely use it in your further developments if you want.
Here is a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Modjo/pen/xLGLvx) to show you how it looks like.
